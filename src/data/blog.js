    title: 'The Science of the Perfect Swirl',
    excerpt: 'Ever wondered what makes our frozen yogurt swirl so perfectly? Dive into the delicious science behind our signature technique.',
    content: `
      <p>There's an art and science to creating the perfect frozen yogurt swirl. At Freeze, we've spent years perfecting our technique, and today we're pulling back the curtain on what makes our swirls so Instagram-worthy.</p>

      <h3>Temperature is Everything</h3>
      <p>The secret starts with temperature control. Our soft serve machines maintain a precise -4°C (25°F), which gives us the perfect consistency—soft enough to swirl beautifully, but firm enough to hold its shape. Go too cold and you get ice crystals; too warm and it melts before you can enjoy it.</p>

      <h3>The Golden Ratio</h3>
      <p>Our frozen yogurt base follows what we call the "golden ratio"—a specific balance of milk fat, sugar, and air (called overrun in the industry). This creates that creamy, light texture that melts perfectly on your tongue.</p>

      <h3>The Technique</h3>
      <p>Our team members train for weeks to master the swirl. It's all in the wrist—a steady rotation while pulling upward creates those beautiful, even layers. The finale? A perfect peak that crowns your cup or cone.</p>

      <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
      <p>Beyond aesthetics, the swirl actually improves your eating experience. More surface area means more flavor hitting your taste buds with each bite. It's science you can taste!</p>

    title: "Freeze's Guide to Guilt-Free Indulgence",
    excerpt: 'Yes, you can enjoy frozen yogurt and still feel good about it. Here\'s how we make it possible.',
    content: `
      <p>At Freeze, we believe that treating yourself shouldn't come with a side of guilt. Here's how we've crafted a menu that lets you indulge responsibly.</p>

      <h3>Lower in Calories</h3>
      <p>Our frozen yogurt contains about 30% fewer calories than traditional ice cream. A small serving of our vanilla base is just 90 calories—leaving plenty of room for toppings!</p>

      <h3>Probiotics Power</h3>
      <p>Unlike ice cream, frozen yogurt contains live and active cultures that support digestive health. Our base includes Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus—the good bacteria your gut loves.</p>

      <h3>Real Fruit Options</h3>
      <p>Many of our flavors are made with real fruit purées, not artificial flavors. Our açaí, pomegranate, and mango options are packed with natural antioxidants.</p>

      <h3>Protein-Packed</h3>
      <p>Each serving contains 4-6 grams of protein, making it a more satisfying snack than many alternatives.</p>

      <h3>Customization is Key</h3>
      <p>You control your portion and toppings. Load up on fresh fruits and nuts for a nutrient boost, or go for the brownie chunks—we won't judge. It's all about balance.</p>

      <h3>Sugar-Free Options</h3>
      <p>We offer several sugar-free base flavors sweetened with stevia for those watching their sugar intake.</p>

    content: `
      <p>Every cup of Freeze frozen yogurt tells a story—a story that starts long before it reaches your hands. Here's a peek behind the curtain at our ingredient sourcing.</p>

      <h3>Local Dairy Partners</h3>
      <p>Our base starts with milk from family farms within 100 miles of our production facility. We've partnered with dairy farmers who share our commitment to quality and sustainable practices.</p>

      <h3>Seasonal Fruits</h3>
      <p>We work with fruit suppliers who prioritize seasonal, ripe produce. Our strawberries come from California in summer, our mangoes from Mexico, and our blueberries from local farms in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

      <h3>Ethical Chocolate</h3>
      <p>All our chocolate—from chips to fudge—is Rainforest Alliance Certified, ensuring fair practices for cocoa farmers and environmental protection.</p>

      <h3>Artisan Partners</h3>
      <p>Our mochi comes from a third-generation Japanese-American family business. Our brownies are baked by a local bakery that employs adults with disabilities. Our granola is handmade by a women-owned cooperative.</p>

      <h3>No Artificial Nasties</h3>
      <p>You won't find artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives in our products. That vibrant purple in our açaí? That's just açaí. The pink in our strawberry? Real strawberries.</p>

      <h3>Continuous Improvement</h3>
      <p>We're constantly evaluating our supply chain to reduce our environmental footprint and support better practices. This year, we're transitioning to fully compostable cups and spoons.</p>
